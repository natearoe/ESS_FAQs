It is intended to be an educational resource and to develop best practice standards. This is intended to be a living document. If you have recommendations for best practices or additional practices that should be added, please let me know! 1.1 Overview This document is divided into 4 sections: mapunits, components, plots, and ecosites. Within those sections are commonly used methodologies relating to the section concept. For example, within the components section are methodologies relating to the use of components (i.e., What are the ecological characteristics of components?). Much of this methodology relies on a combination of NASIS and R. It is my objective to make the R examples clear enough that someone with minimal to no experience with R can reproduce these examples. 1.2 OBCD Connection As mentioned, these methodologies frequently utilize R and NASIS. To accomplish this, you will need to have R installed and establish an ODBC connection to NASIS. This is outlined in detail by the NRCS Stats for Soil Survey pre-course assignment. "],["mapunits.html", "Chapter 2 Mapunits 2.1 What mapunits are in an MLRA? 2.2 Mapping mapunits", " Chapter 2 Mapunits This section deals with mapunits. Mapunits have limited application for ecological work because they are broad concepts. Mapunits frequently contain multiple components, each occurring on different parts of the landscape and having different soil properties. Ecosites are correlated to components rather than mapunits because of the variability of mapunits. It should be noted that mapunits are spatially delineated, though, whereas components are not. Therefore, an attempt to map ecosites would rely heavily on mapunit delineations. An example of this can be seen on Soil Web. Soil Web can be used to map ecosites. These maps use mapunit delineations and show the ecosites that is correlated to the dominant component in that mapunit. For the purpose of this document, mapunits are primarily used as intermediate steps in different methodologies. For example, the EXPORT - Ecological site concept data by MUKEY list v3 (NASIS &gt; Reports &gt; MLRA02_Davis &gt; EXPORT - Ecological site concept data by MUKEY list v3) is particularly useful and requires mapunits as input. Therefore, determining what mapunits are in your area of interest is helpful. The NRCS has four soil mapping products: SSURGO, gSSURGO, STATSGO, and gNATSGO. SSURGO is the most detailed product but is not available in all areas of the country. The resolution of SSURGO data ranges from 1:12,0000 to 1:63,360. gSSURGO is a gridded (rasterized) version of SSURGO - hence the g prefix. It covers the same areas as SSURGO but is gridded at a 10-meter cell size. STATSGO is a less detailed product but is available across all parts of the US. The resolution is 1:250,0000 in the continental US, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. In Alaska, the resolution is 1:1,000,000. gNATSGO is a gridded combination of SSURGO and STATSGO. gNATSGO is primarily SSURGO data, but where SSURGO is unavailable, STATSGO is used to fill the gaps. The state-wide geodatabases are 10-meter cell sizes and the CONUS database is a 30-meter cell size. 2.1 What mapunits are in an MLRA? If your MLRA uses primarily SSURGO data, the Mapunit in MLRA tool is the best option. It allow you to simply enter your MLRA of interest and define what percent of the total mapunit acreage must be within your MLRA for the mapunit to be considered a member of your MLRA of interest. Note that this tool will make two groups of mapunits if there are more than 2,100 mapunits. This happens because most NASIS queries do not allow for more than 2,100 mapunits to be included in a query. Why not use a NASIS Query that queries components by MLRA, like NASIS &gt; Queries &gt; NSSC Pangaea &gt; Area/Legend/Mapunit/DMU by MLRA? Unfortunately, this is not the most reliable way to determine what mapunits are in an MLRA. Mapunits are assigned to an MLRA via the mapunit area overlap table. These tables are not perfectly populated. Some mapunits are not assigned to an MLRA and other could be assigned to multiple MLRAs. For this reason, using a spatial intersection, as is done in the Mapunit in MLRA tool is the preferred approach. 2.2 Mapping mapunits Using Soil Web and R. "],["components.html", "Chapter 3 Components 3.1 What components are in an MLRA? 3.2 What components are in a Soil Survey Area? 3.3 What components are correlated to what ecosites? 3.4 What components are correlated to an ecosite of interest? 3.5 What are the ecological characteristics of components? 3.6 Where do components occur? 3.7 How to correlate components to ecosites?", " Chapter 3 Components Components are one of the core concepts in the NRCS ecological workflow. Ecosites are correlated to components. This 3.1 What components are in an MLRA? There are NASIS Queries that allow querying by MLRA. Unfortunately, this is not the best approach. See the section What mapunits are in an MLRA for an explanation of why. Spatial intersection of MLRA boundaries and mapunits is more reliable. Determine the mapunits in the MLRA using the Mapunits in MLRA tool Take the group of mapunits and enter them into Query &gt; MLRA09_Temple &gt; ARE/LMU/MU/DMU by Lmukey list. Run against National Database: Run against Local: Acquire the component names and component IDs using R: Load the soilDB package and fetch NASIS data library(soilDB) my.components.MLRA &lt;- fetchNASIS(from = &quot;components&quot;) Look at component names - the head() function shows just the first six records. Remove the head() function to see all the component names head(my.components.MLRA$compname) ## [1] &quot;Jokerst&quot; &quot;Doemill&quot; &quot;Rockstripe&quot; &quot;Ultic Haploxeralfs&quot; &quot;Butterbredt&quot; &quot;Butterbredt, eroded&quot; Look at the component IDs head(my.components.MLRA$coiid) ## [1] &quot;1047328&quot; &quot;1047328&quot; &quot;1047328&quot; &quot;1047329&quot; &quot;1047329&quot; &quot;1047329&quot; 3.2 What components are in a Soil Survey Area? Queries by Soil Survey Area are much more reliable than queries by MLRA. As previously mentioned, queries by MLRA are not ideal because the mapunit overlap tables are imperfectly populated. The Soil Survey area corresponds to the legend, and this means that components are reliably associated with Soil Survey Areas. Therefore, beginning with a query is the preferred approach: Run against National Run against Local Acquire component names and IDs using R. Load the soilDB package and fetch NASIS data library(soilDB) my.components.SSA &lt;- fetchNASIS(from = &quot;components&quot;) Look at component names - the head() function shows just the first six records.

Perhaps we want to see what ecosite each component is correlated to. For this example, we will work with all the components in MLRA 18. We will continue from What mapunits are in an MLRA?. You should have the object my.components.MLRA loaded. Load a couple of necessary packages library(dplyr) library(aqp) Now, lets look at the correlations between component ID and ecosite ID. This script takes our components in MLRA 18, pulls out the site level data (allows us to ignore pedon data), and then selects only the columns for component ID and ecosite ID (there are lots of other columns you can choose from, tailor to your needs). Finally we look at just the head() of the comp.ecosite.correlations. If you want to see the full dataframe, remove head(). comp.ecosite.correlations &lt;- my.components.MLRA %&gt;% aqp::site() %&gt;% select(coiid, ecosite_id) head(comp.ecosite.correlations) ## coiid ecosite_id ## 1 1047328 R018XA103CA ## 2 1047329 R018XA103CA ## 3 1047374 R018XA104CA ## 4 1047375 F018XA202CA ## 5 1061198 R030XA020CA ## 6 1061613 R030XA020CA 3.4 What components are correlated to an ecosite of interest? Perhaps there is a specific ecosite we are interested in and we want to see what components are correlated to that ecosite. Lets say the ecosite is R018XI202CA. We will start with the comp.ecosite.correlations dataframe that we created in the previous example. R018XI202CA &lt;- comp.ecosite.correlations %&gt;% filter(ecosite_id == &quot;F018XA202CA&quot;) head(R018XI202CA) # Again, remove head() to see the full list. ## coiid ecosite_id ## 1 1047375 F018XA202CA ## 2 1122909 F018XA202CA ## 3 1153760 F018XA202CA ## 4 1153763 F018XA202CA ## 5 1153765 F018XA202CA ## 6 1153766 F018XA202CA 3.5 What are the ecological characteristics of components? One of the best ways to do this is a NASIS report: NASIS &gt; Reports &gt; MLRA02_Davis &gt; EXPORT - Ecological site concept data by MUKEY list v3. This report takes mapunit keys (MUKEY) as input. If you are interested in all the components in an MLRA, refer to What mapunits are in an MLRA?. If you are interested in a Soil Survey Area  Run against National In the resulting output (html output in your browser), click anywhere, ctrl + a (select all), ctrl + c (copy) Open Excel, click in top left cell, ctrl + v (paste) Ctrl + a (select all), Insert &gt; Table Now you have a table with lots of ecological characteristics. You can use the column headers to filter in various ways. If you prefer to work in R, save this file as a .csv and read it into R. 3.6 Where do components occur? 3.7 How to correlate components to ecosites?
