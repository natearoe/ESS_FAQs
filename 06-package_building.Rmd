## Package building/maintaining tips

This section has helpful reminders for building and maintaining R packages. 

Update package documentation
```{r}
# devtools::document()
```

Add package
```{r}
# use_package()
```

Add function from package. Adding a function from a package instead of the whole package keeps things lighter weight. If you want to just add a function, use the script below and put it in your function.R file where you use their function. 
```{r}
# @importFrom package-name object1 object2 objectn
```

Make a package documentation file
```{r}
# usethis::use_package_doc()
```
