## Organizing scanned data

Often times, you likely want to store a digital copy of your datasheets in an organized fashion. The following workflow makes that process more efficient, and reduced the tedious steps of creating/naming folders, naming files, separating pdfs manually, or using pictures. Instead, you can use the office scanner and scan all of your datasheets at once into a single pdf file. Then, using R we will separate that one pdf file into individual pdfs, one pdf for each site. Each pdf will be named based on the associated site id and put in a folder with the same site id. Let's go over the steps - 

1. Organize your paper datasheets in numerical order
2. Scan your paper datasheets using the office scanner. You should be able to feed all of the datasheets in at once. The result is a single pdf file with all of your sites.
3. Determine the site numbers. This step requires either extracting the site numbers from a GPS device, NASIS, or some other source OR typing the site numbers manually. Typing the site numbers manually would look like this:
```{r}
my_site_number <- c(401, 402, 403, 404, 405)
```

Depending on what you have available and your skillset (willing to use soilDB to pull sites/pedons under your name in NASIS, etc.), you may have to enter this manually. This will be the only manual portion though. 

4. Install the ecositer R package
```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("natearoe/ecositer", dependencies = FALSE)
```

5. Look at the help file for the scanned_data_organizer() function in R
```{r, eval=FALSE}
?ecositer::scanned_data_organizer()
```

6. Run scanned data_organizer(). Here is some example code:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
ecositer::scanned_data_organizer(scanned_data_path = "S:/NRCS/XEROX SCANS/DOC057.pdf",
directory = "C:/Users/Nathan.Roe/Documents/Alaska2023/Willow_project",
year_state_fips = "2023AK185",
site_number = my_site_number)
```

That's it! You now have a folder for each site that contains a pdf of that site's datasheet. There is also an all_sites folder containing all of the site pdfs together in one location.
