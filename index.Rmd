# Introduction

This documents outlines common methodologies used by NRCS Ecologists. It is intended to be an educational resource and to develop best practice standards. This is intended to be a living document. If you have recommendations for best practices or additional practices that should be added, please let me know!

## Overview 

This document is divided into 4 sections: mapunits, components, plots, and ecosites. Within those sections are commonly used methodologies relating to the section concept. For example, within the components section are methodologies relating to the use of components (i.e., What are the ecological characteristics of components?). 

Much of this methodology relies on a combination of NASIS and R. It is my objective to make the R examples clear enough that someone with minimal to no experience with R can reproduce these examples. 

## OBCD Connection

As mentioned, these methodologies frequently utilize R and NASIS. To accomplish this, you will need to have R installed and establish an ODBC connection to NASIS. This is outlined in detail by the NRCS Stats for Soil Survey [pre-course assignment](http://ncss-tech.github.io/stats_for_soil_survey/chapters/0_pre-class-assignment/pre-class-assignment.html#1_USDA_Computer_Setup).
